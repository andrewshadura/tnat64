# This is the configuration for libtsocks (transparent socks)
# Lines beginning with # and blank lines are ignored

# The basic idea is to specify:
#   - Local subnets - Networks that can be accessed directly without
#     being routed to NAT64
#   - Paths - Paths are basically lists of networks and NAT64 prefix
#     which can be used to reach these networks
#   - Default server - NAT64 prefix which should be used to access 
#     networks for which no path is available
# Much more documentation than provided in these comments can be found in
# the man pages, tnat64(8) and tnat64.conf(8)

# Local networks
# For this example this machine can directly access 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 
# (192.168.0.*) and 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 (10.*)

local = 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0
local = 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0

# Paths
# For this example this machine needs to access 150.0.0.0/255.255.0.0 as 
# well as port 80 on the network 150.1.0.0/255.255.0.0 through
# the NAT64 with the prefix 2001:aaa:bbbb:0:ccc:616::/96

path {
	subnet = 150.0.0.0/255.255.0.0
	subnet = 150.1.0.0:80/255.255.0.0
    nat64_prefix = 2001:aaa:bbbb:0:ccc:616::
}

# Default NAT64 prefix
# For connections that aren't to the local subnets or to 150.0.0.0/255.255.0.0
# the NAT64 with the prefix 2001:bbb:aaaa:0:ddd:717::/96 should be used

nat64_prefix = 2001:bbb:aaaa:0:ddd:717::
